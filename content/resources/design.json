        "description": "I had to design a table for a client in Sketch, so I did a quick search for dynamic Sketch table symbols/components, and I couldn't track anything down that was actually dynamic. Most tables were 'hard coded' in a sense, with their columns and rows defined by line shapes, instead of individual cells, making it impossible to change the table format beyond the template. So I set off and created my own dynamic Sketch table and decided to share it with everyone(because tables are hard enough right? 😅😵)",
